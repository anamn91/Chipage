<div id="intro">
<p>There are two types of chi. <strong>Short hair chihuahuas</strong> and <strong>long hair chihuahuas</strong>. 
Both are equally perfect, and are superior to other creatures on earth.
<p style="margin-bottom: 30px"></p>
Both types of chihuahua belong to the same breed and have most of the same general characteristics. Long haired chihuahuas simply have a genetic variation that gives them longer, fluffier fur. A common misconception is that long-haired chihuahuas have a difference in personality. This is not true. They generally have the same range of personality types as ones with shorter hair.</p>

<h2> Short Hair Chihuahuas: AKA Gremlin Dumplings</h2>
<p> The world’s smallest dogs, Chihuahuas make good companions. They bond strongly with their owners, are quick-witted and easily trained – as long as you start early. They can be prickly around strangers as they like to have all of their owner’s attention for themselves.

<h2> Long Hair Chihuahuas: AKA Floofy botts</h2>
<p> While they are a charming breed, chis have a tendency to be a bit sassy. The Chihuahua Club of America actually refers to the breed's expression as "saucy." (hahahah)
<p style="margin-bottom: 30px"></p>
Also they live up to 18 years. So you could have another 16 years of Wesley potentially. SIXTEEN whole years of Wesley sauce!</p>
